-------------------------------Project Purpose-------------------------------

InterviewSense AI is a dual-sided AI-powered interview intelligence platform designed to:
- Help job seekers improve interview performance through AI-driven practice
- Assist HR professionals in conducting more structured and consistent candidate evaluation
- Reduce subjectivity in interview assessment using behavioral analytics

-------------------------------Problem Statement-------------------------------

Job Seekers Face:
- Interview anxiety and nervousness
- Lack of structured behavioral feedback
- Limited awareness of non-verbal impact (blink rate, vocal stability, response coherence)
- No personalized guidance for improvement

HR Professionals Face:
- Subjective and inconsistent candidate evaluation
- Difficulty measuring confidence and delivery objectively
- Limited tools for structured behavioral comparison

-------------------------------AI Integration-------------------------------

InterviewSense AI uses Google Gemini (via Google AI Studio) as the core reasoning engine to:

-Generate resume-aware interview questions dynamically during AI practice
-Interpret response transcripts contextually rather than using keyword matching
-Analyze structured behavioral signals (audio stability, blink rate, facial expression patterns)
-Aggregate multimodal signals into confidence and nervousness indicators
-Generate structured summary reports with improvement suggestions and AI-suggested model answers


AI is fundamental to the system. Without Gemini, the platform would only display raw behavioral metrics without contextual reasoning, personalized feedback, or structured evaluation insights.

-------------------------------SDG Alignment-------------------------------

This project aligns with SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth by:
- Enhancing employability skills
- Improving interview readiness and communication confidence
- Supporting fairer and more structured hiring practices
- Reducing skill perception gaps between job seekers and employers


InterviewSense AI promotes workforce readiness through meaningful AI integration in interview preparation and structured evaluation.
